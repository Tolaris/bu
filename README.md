bu
==

My fast backup utility for Linux command-line systems. Backs up a file
or directory and names it by date. Use it before editing critical files.

Example
==
bu /etc/hosts

This creates "/etc/hosts_2014-11-14_16.05.01" with a copy of this file.
Also works recursively on directories, and has some helpful switches.
